# AN√çMATE!
## Second WCS project

This idea is based on what is missing in others event apps. We want to use the generalitat api for develop a program where you can filter al the events of Catalunya by the city, the category and the day. After that the user will have the posibility to chanche the view of the events from list to map view an also to change with a calendar displayed the date to see other events 

For this React project whe organice the components like this:
* App.js 
    * Filters
        * Calendar
            * Event List
                * Event Details
            * Event Map
                * Event Details
